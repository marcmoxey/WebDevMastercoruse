                        "Given the success of our industry leading TVS1320
                        Supercharger Kit for the FA20 engine, our engineering
                        team have designed and developed a TVS1320 Supercharger
                        to suit the FA24 found in the new Toyota GR86 and Subaru
                        BRZ platforms. Designed and manufactured to OE
                        standards, the front drive / front inlet design allows
                        for a shorter less restrictive intake path allowing for
                        improved air flow and superior performance. The
                        integrated design utilising two high density water to
                        air intercoolers provides optimal air distribution over
                        the intercooler face. Installation is of OE appearance
                        and fitment, leveraged from designing and supplying OE
                        supercharger programs including Ford and Lotus.

                        Tomei has really done it this time. Notice a lack of a
                        certain word in the title of this product? The missing
                        word is tip. That word is missing because this is an
                        entire Titanium exhaust at a very affordable price.
                        Tomei starts with the very best in raw materials and
                        takes it to the next level. This exhaust is about one
                        thing and one thing only; performance. They have started
                        by stripping the weight down to what feels like nothing
                        compared to the stock exhaust. They did this by using
                        titanium over steel and making the exhaust as straight
                        as possible. Less bends means less materials used. They
                        even went so far as to think about the extra weight
                        regular style flanges add, so they went ahead and went
                        with a weight-saving spring and clamp setup. So not only
                        do you get the performance you expect from a Tomei
                        product, you get the bragging rights too.
